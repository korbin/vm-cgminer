In additions to windows-built.txt, I needed to:

Get mingw from:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/OldFiles/mingw-get-inst/mingw-get-inst-20120426/

From mingw console:
mingw-get install autoconf
mingw-get install libtool


https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win32/dependencies/
- pkg-config-dev_0.26-1_win32.zip
- pkg-config_0.26-1_win32.zip

Libusb can be downloaded at the following under download menu and windows binaries.

Found compatible curl 7.80.0 library for mingw at:

with main site at: https://github.com/curl/curl-for-win

Needed to make libcurl.pc file in /lib/pkgconfig/
-ex. https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/libcurl.pc.in

make CFLAGS="-std=gnu99"
